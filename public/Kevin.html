		<h2> From the Coach's Desk </h2>
		<p>Hey everyone, I'm Kevin, the Kevmissioner and founder of the CIL. I also made this website :]
		</br>
		</br>
		When I started this, I didn't know if anyone would even join, and when they did, I didn't know it would continue season after season. It only does so thanks to the help I get from the Chasemissioner and Mavmissioner as well as the many great coaches who have joined the CIL over the years... and also from no shortage of strawpolls :] 
		</br>
		</br>
		So thanks for stopping by to check us out and if you're interested in being a part of our fun community, let me know on Twitter. Just click my picture :]

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        
		<h4>How long have you been playing Pokemon?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Too long lol. Since 1999 with good ol' Pokemon Blue. </p>

		<h4>How would you describe your playstyle?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses">Heat ;]  I used to like hyper-offense but I've found it to be volatile and prefer to minimize the need for predictions as much as possible for more reliable outcomes--after all, Pokemon is a game of odds. </br></br> Ultimately this leads me towards balance, but I always try to draft a team that not only has versatile Pokemon, but also can be built to suit different playstyles so that I can build balance, hyper-offense, volt-turn, etc, to make it even more unpredictable.</p>

		<h4>What's your favorite Pokemon to draft?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I try to draft different things each time but in the past, I've really enjoyed building with Clefable (the famed Lil' Cletus), and Snorlax (the legendary Beef Jones). If a Pokemon can win games on its own with minimal support, I love it. </p>

		<h4>If you could make a new Alolan-form for a Pokemon without one, what would you make and what would it be like? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Alolan Rapidash--Fairy/Fire with the ability Levitate and I'd give it wings so it's basically a pegasus. I'd also give it a special fairy move that would be something rainbow-y haha. Maybe like Rainbow Horn. It would have 100 base power, 100 accuracy, Fairy typing, and would damage the target based on their lowest defensive stat.</p>

		<h4>If you could make a new Mega Pokemon for a Pokemon without one, what would you make and what would it be like?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I really like Octillery and think cephalopods are generally under appreciated in the Pokemon universe since they're such cool creatures in the real world.  I think I'd give it a mega with a lot more bulk, Recover, and the ability Regenerator. </p>

		<h4>What new Pokemon would you most like to see in the next generation? As many details as you'd like (typing, ability, stats, etc).  </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Honestly, I just want to see the type chart filled out, but also something to really put pressure on Lando-T. I'm thinking like a Steel/Dragon with Levitate, good bulk, reliable recovery, and switch initiative. </p>

		<h4>Aside from trainer, what job would you have in the Pokemon universe? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I think being a gym leader would be cool. I saw once that they help teach young trainers so that plus a lot of battles would probably be fun.</p>

		<h4>Where would you live in the Pokemon universe? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Anywhere warm, like in Alola. Hau'oli city, probably since it has a lot going on. </p>

		<h4>Do you follow any well-known Pokemon players? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Many of them, actually, though I don't have time to watch a lot of it since so much content gets pumped out.  I tend to follow Lord Emvee and Pokeaim the closest since they play the same formats I do and similar styles, but this could be a long list of people. G0ldazu, Cybertron, Wolfe, Chimpact, Geo, and of course KantoCast, to name a few :]  </p>

		<h4>Who is your favorite character in the entire Pokemon universe? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I've always thought Colress was really cool. There's a lot of mystery around him but he seems like a truly neutral person with an unrelenting curiosity and work ethic. The morally gray aspect makes him intriguing as well.</p>

		<h4>If you were getting "shipped" with one character from the Pokemon universe, who would you choose and why? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Hmm... I think Skyla. I'm mostly over my fear of heights but if I had to fly around on a Pokemon's back, I might feel pretty uneasy doing so, so the fact she's a pilot means we could probably get around more easily. </p>

		<h4>Favorite Pokemon? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Umbreon. I name mine Osiris after my cat because he's the cutest cat of all time and they look quite similar. </p>

		<h4>Least favorite Pokemon?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Probably Garbodor because it's literally trash. It feels lazy and uninspired, which is frustrating as a fan, especially when fans themselves come up with so many incredible designs that Pokemon could easily buy from them...but I'm gonna stop myself before I start ranting lol. </p>

		<h4>Favorite starter Pokemon? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> If just the first form, Litten, but Incineroar was such a disappointing Pokemon...however, if I'm going to later evolve this Pokemon, then Chimchar, closely followed by Charmander. </p>

		<h4>Favorite Eeveelution? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Since Umbreon is my favorite Pokemon... but my second is Espeon. </p>

		<h4>Favorite legendary Pokemon? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> This is so freaking hard... Mewtwo has a special place in my heart for both nostalgia and being the most relatable but I love the designs for Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Zekrom. </p>

		<h4>Cutest Pokemon? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Probably Mew, because there's a lot of cute Pokemon, but Mew is the only one who has also shown a sense of humor :] </p>

		<h4>Favorite Pokemon type? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Another tough one...I feel like this could vary day-to-day but it's always going to be among Dragon, Dark, Fighting, Electric, and Psychic. If it has to be one, I'll say Dragon.</p>

		<h4>Favorite Z-Move? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses">Pulverizing Pancake obviously, but Shattered Psyche probably comes in second for me.</p>

		<h4>Favorite villain team? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> If I had to join them, probably Team Magma. Trying to create more land for people actually makes sense, even if their methods were flawed.</p>

		<h4>Favorite Pokemon Professor? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Professor Oak, of course! Nostalgia dictates this one but I also didn't watch the show long enough to get to know the other professors. </p>

		<h4>Favorite gym leader? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I guess Flannery.  There's a few really cool ones but not only do I like the fact that she's under a lot of pressure and trying hard to live up to her new title, but she's also right up there with Skyla for the question about shipping haha.</p>

		<h4>Favorite Elite Four member?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Koga! He's a ninja and Poison types are underrated. </p>

		<h4>Favorite generation of Pokemon?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Gen 4 was the best for me because I loved the move-specific physical/special split, the new evolutions of so-so Pokemon from previous gens were great, the new Pokemon were also fun, the region and the games were cool and the remakes (HG/SS) were perfect. </p>

		<h4>Most frustrating character in Pokemon?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Ash. How are you this bad after TWENTY YEARS, ASH?! </p>

		<h4>If you had to eat a Pokemon, which one would you eat and why?</h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> Bouffalant. I don't know if you've ever had a bison burger, but you should. </p>

		<h4> What Pokemon is your spirit Pokemon/ which are you most like? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I think Hydreigon is a good one for me for a long list of reasons, but the typing feels right and I like that it can be very versatile. </p>

		<h4>What's the best thing about Pokemon? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> A year ago, I might have said the tactical nature of the game or that there are so many ways to play it, but after attending events like Nats and Worlds, and really being immersed in the CIL, it has to be the way this game brings people together.  I really doubt I'd still be playing to the level I do if not for all the great friends I've made through those trips, the CIL, and the Kanto Nation :] </p>

		<h4> What other games do you like to play? </h4>
		<p class="coach-responses"> I rarely have time to game, unfort, so it's usually just this. Past faves are: Smash Bros (all but Melee), Tales of Symphonia 1 and 2 (maybe my second favorite franchise of all time), Tetris Attack (SNES),  Madden, Warriors games, Mario games, Zelda games, Sonic games, the God of War series, Conker's Bad Fur Day (N64), Diabolo III, LOTR games... basically any sufficiently interesting action game, ideally with a good story driving it. </p>

		<h4>When you're not gaming, what are we likely to find you doing?</h4>	
		<p class="coach-responses"> Oh man...a lot of things. I like to do stuff like this (coding, making the website), and I'm really into sports, especially MMA. I don't actively train with many others since I haven't had health insurance for a few years, but I do still train and I follow the UFC pretty closely.  I also love movies, music, reading, learning, travelling, and hanging out with family and friends :] </p>
